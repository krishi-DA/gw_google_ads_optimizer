Term Optimization**\n- **Pause/Reduce:** Generic terms like \"3pl\" showing higher junk rates in your campaign\n- **Increase Budget:** Focus on high-intent terms that align with your 56.7% quality benchmark\n- **Add Negatives:** Block terms generating \"parcel tracking\" and other irrelevant queries noted in junk leads\n\n**2. Quality Improvement Focus**\n- Current junk rate of 19.9% needs reduction\n- Common junk reasons from this campaign include service mismatches and unqualified inquiries\n- Implement pre-qualification questions in landing pages\n\n**3. Bidding Strategy Refinement**\n- With 637 leads generated, you have sufficient data for Smart Bidding optimization\n- Consider switching to Target CPA based on your quality lead threshold (Score >70)\n- Set CPA targets based on your 56.7% quality conversion rate\n\n**4. Geographic Targeting**\n- Compare performance with location-specific campaigns (GW_Core series averaging 54-85% quality)\n- Consider creating location-specific ad groups within Lead-MaximiseConv\n\n**5. Landing Page Alignment**\n- Address the mismatch between ad promise and landing page content\n- Ensure clear service descriptions to reduce \"Not Interested\" outcomes (163 occurrences across dataset)\n\nYour campaign is mid-performing - focus on quality over quantity to improve ROI.",

Communication Issues (38% of junk reasons)**\n- **No Response/Not Answering**: Most common pattern\n- **Call Declined/Busy**: Leads actively avoiding contact\n- **Wrong Contact Numbers**: Invalid or incomplete phone numbers\n- Examples: \"no answer\", \"call declined\", \"number busy\", \"call not received\"\n\n**2. Duplicate Entries (16% of junk reasons)**  \n- **System Duplicates**: Same leads assigned multiple times\n- **Previous Assignments**: Leads already handled by other team members\n- Examples: \"duplicate entry\", \"already earlier lead is assigned to Ravi sir\"\n\n**3. Wrong Requirements (15% of junk reasons)**\n- **Non-warehouse Services**: Seeking transportation, logistics only, or unrelated services\n- **Inappropriate Use Cases**: Music classes, residential space, GST registration only\n- Examples: \"need logistics service only\", \"want 2000-3000 sqft area for music classes\", \"only want space for GST\"\n\n**4. Budget/Commercial Misalignment (12% of junk reasons)**\n- **No Budget Mentioned**: Prospects without defined budgets\n- **Rate Expectations**: Seeking rates below viable thresholds\n- Examples: \"budget not fixed\", \"rate per sq. ft seems to be very high\"\n\n**5. Timing Issues (8% of junk reasons)**\n- **No Immediate Requirement**: Future needs without current urgency\n- **Decision Delays**: Waiting for approvals or management decisions\n- Examples: \"no immediate requirement\", \"will update in mid of Aug\"\n\n### **Campaign-Specific Issues:**\n\n**Highest Junk Campaigns:**\n- **Unnamed Campaign**: 496 junk leads (poor targeting)\n- **Lead-MaximiseConv**: 286 junk leads (broad match issues)\n- **Warehouse_Lead**: 226 junk leads (generic targeting)\n\n**Problematic Keywords:**\n- **Blank keywords ('')**: 656 junk leads (tracking issues)\n- **'warehouse for rent'**: 170 junk leads (attracts property seekers)\n- **'3pl logistics services'**: 96 junk leads (too broad)\n\n### **Actionable Recommendations:**\n\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. **Implement Lead Qualification**: Add mandatory budget and timeline fields\n2. **Fix Tracking**: Resolve blank keyword issue (656 junk leads)\n3. **Duplicate Prevention**: Implement CRM deduplication before assignment\n4. **Contact Validation**: Verify phone numbers before lead processing\n\n**Campaign Optimization:**\n1. **Refine Targeting**: Add negative keywords for property rental, transportation-only\n2. **Budget Qualifiers**: Include minimum budget requirements in ad copy\n3. **Service Clarity**: Clearly specify 3PL vs warehouse rental in campaigns\n\n**Process Improvements:**\n1. **Pre-qualification Script**: Screen for immediate needs and budget authority\n2. **Response Tracking**: Flag non-responsive leads after 3 attempts\n3. **Service Matching**: Route logistics-only inquiries to appropriate partners\n\nThe 35.5% junk rate is primarily driven by poor lead qualification, broad targeting, and system issues rather than market problems.",
